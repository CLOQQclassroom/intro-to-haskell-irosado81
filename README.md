These are the files I tweak on almost a daily basis, it's a serious addiction.

## Before you install
I recommend using [Strap](https://github.com/mikemcquaid/strap) by [@mikemcquaid](https://github.com/mikemcquaid) to setup your
development environment if you just cracked open your brand new laptop and don't have anything setup yet.

## Install
3 Easy steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/tarebyte/dotfile ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles

script/bootstrap
```

And that's it! This will symlink any .symlink file into your home directory
